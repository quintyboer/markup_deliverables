I have created a pull request that can be automatically merged to an old markup course repository. The pull request in the old course repository can be found [here](https://github.com/gerkovink/markup2020/pull/160). It is also referenced as an issue in this repository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/quintyboer/markup_deliverables/issues/1)

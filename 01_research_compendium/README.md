### Description

This research compendium includes a simulation example based on the paper ['Introduction to statistical simulations in health research'](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/12/e039921) by Boulesteix et al. (2020)[^1]. The compendium includes a reproducible manuscript and the files required to reproduce the simulation example provided in the original paper.

### Content Overview:

The compendium is organised into the following sections:

- **data:** The 5 datasets from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) used in the simulation example in Boulesteix et al. (2020)[^1]. More information on the data can be found on the [NHANES website](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/).
For this compendium, the datasets were directly downloaded from <https://github.com/gerkovink/markup/blob/main/documents/week-4/raw_data>

- **docs:** The manuscript pdf, source file and references for reproducing the simulation example.

- **scripts:** The original R script provided in the supplemental material of Boulesteix et al. (2020)[^1].

- **results:** The reproduced plot from the [original paper (Figure 2)](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/10/12/e039921/F2.large.jpg)

- **renv.lock:** Captures the R environment used in the project to ensure that others can recreate the computational environment in which the scripts were run.
